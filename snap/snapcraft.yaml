description: |
  Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more
  functionality behind a single, common interface.

  - ‚ö°Ô∏è 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black)
  - üêß Installable via `snap`
  - üõ†Ô∏è `pyproject.toml` support
  - ü§ù Python 3.12 compatibility
  - ‚öñÔ∏è Drop-in parity with Flake8, isort, and Black
  - üì¶ Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
  - üîß Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports)
  - üìè Over 700 built-in rules, with native re-implementations of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
  - ‚å®Ô∏è First-party editor integrations for VS Code and more
  - üåé Monorepo-friendly, with hierarchical and cascading configuration

# Performance difference with xz vs lzo is small in this case, but provides
